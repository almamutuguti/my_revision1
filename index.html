    <h1><u><em><strong>So Far..</strong></em></u></h1>

    <h2><u>Summary</u></h2>

    <p>
        So far what the teacher has come to my understanding. I have learnt about the elements
        concerning :
        <ul>
            <li>paragraphs</li>
            <li>heading</li>
            <li>emphasing</li>
            <li>bold</li>
            <li>italics</li>
            <li>underlining</li>
            <li>listing

                <ol>
                    <li>ordered lists</li>
                    <li>unordered lists</li>
                </ol>
            
            </li>
            <li>writing comments</li>
            <li>superscripting</li>
            <li>subscripting</li>
            <li>strike through</li>
            
        </ul>
        
        
    </p>

    <p>
        In the process Mr Joseph gave examples and gave us students a chance to practise
        so that the concepts can be able to sink in.As began we downloaded some extension such as: 
        <ul>
            <li>live server</li>
            <li>auto complete</li>
            <li>eslint</li>
        </ul>

        I believe more are yet to be downloaded as we progress in learning.
    </p>

    <p>
        In the beginning, we started by working on <strong><em> git bash</em></strong> which
         was abit challenging however I got to understand it.
    </p>

    <em><u><h4>In Git..</h4></u></em>

    <p>
        Like I said before, it was a bit complicated. At the end, i got to understand;
        
        <ul>
            <li>How to make folders [mkdir]</li>
            <li>How to print working directory [pwd]</li>
            <li>How to change directory [cd]</li>
            <li>How to make files [echo >] or [touch]</li>
            <li>How to delete folders and files
                
                <ul>
                    <li><em>Folders</em>
                    <ol>
                        <li>[rmdir] -folder-</li>
                        <li>[rm -rf] -folder- to force delete</li>
                    </ol>
                    </li>

                    <li><em>Files</em>
                    <ol>
                        <li>[rm] -file-</li>
                        <li>[rm -rf] -file </li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                </ul>
            
            </li>
            <li>How to list contents in a folder [ls]</li>
            <li>How to create a repository</li>
            <li>How to connect VsCode with your working folder [code .]</li>
            
        </ul>

        <em><u><strong>Warning!</strong></u></em> the delete tag should not be used aimlessly
        because important data can be erased and barely retraced.
    </p>

    <p>
        <h5><u><strong>GitHub</strong></u></h5>
        I learnt how to push my folder to my git account which requires certain steps;

        <ul>
            <li>git init</li>
            <li>git add .</li>
            <li>git commit -m</li>
            <li><s>git status -to check status if need be.-</s></li>
            <li>git branch -M -to change to main branch.-</li>
            <li>git remote [URL]</li>
            <li>git push -u origin main</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <em><strong>Parting short</strong></em>;

    <p>
        I love the lessons we are having because they are so impactful and educative thanks to
        a very hardworking and dedicated team of mentors in Zindua School including Mr Joseph.
        From the orientation session by Madam Jemimah and Mr Jesse.
    </p>

    <p>
        My goal at the end of the course is to be way ahead of my peers by becoming a software 
        developer at a very young age as well as a cybersecurity proffesional.
